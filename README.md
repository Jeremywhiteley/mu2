The Meaningful Use (MU2) Repo
=============================

This repository contains information on Meaningful Use Stage 2 Certification. 
Contents include, test data, test software, links to public test tool servers, 
and other related Information. Much of the information included here is 
in README files (in Markdown format) so this repository is partly a wiki.

The materials found here are under development and are frequently updated 
as information becomes available.  The information here may not represent 
final releases of information by any government organization. This information
is provided "as-is" for convenience.  Check back for frequent updates.
